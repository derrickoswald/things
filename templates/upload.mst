                    <h2>Upload</h2>
                    Download the torrent file by clicking on the link below, save it, and together
                    with the files that you specified in the base torrent file in Step 1,
                    seed your thing in your BitTorrent client.
                    <div id="bencode_content"></div>
                    Then you can publish your <em>Thing</em> by proudly displaying this magnet link.
                    <div id="magnet_content"></div>
                    Alternatively, you can push this button to send the thing to the server that
                    served this page and let the <em>Thing Tracker Network</em> handle it.
